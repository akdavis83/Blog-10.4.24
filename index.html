        <div class="blog-slider__text">I have done, and will continue to do my best to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am an unprofitable servant, I have done what is my duty to do, my conscience is clean, and I have no guilt on my hands or my heart according to the scriptures. If anyone is unwilling to hear, I can do nothing about that except pray.</div>

        <div class="blog-slider__title">What else is going on?</div>
        <div class="blog-slider__text">Persecution is part of the gospel, the enemy hates all of humanity but most will never see that our daily plight is greater than our temporal struggles and so all that leaves us with is the natural realm and the things contained therein. Hell was not made for humanity but for the devil and his angels, when that reality really sinks in we can begin to see what it really is all about.</div>

        <div class="blog-slider__text">(Eze 3:18-21) When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</div>
